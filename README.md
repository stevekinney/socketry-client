## Socketry (Client)

A simple chat application built with Ember.js and using WebSockets. Pairs with [stevekinney/socketry-server](https://github.com/stevekinney/socketry-server).

This little server was originally written for my talk on integrating WebSockets with Ember.js, which I presented at [the November meeting of Denver Ember.js](http://www.meetup.com/Ember-js-Denver/photos/25750812/#431722682).
